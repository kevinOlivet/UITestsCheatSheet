# UITestsCheatSheet

This project is full of great example of how to test the UI.

It covers: 
if elements exist, 
exists with predicate, 
tapping buttons, 
typing text in a textfield, 
dismissing an alert, 
dismissing a system alert, 
adjusting a slider, 
adjusting a picker, 
waiting for elements to appear, 
existing text in webViews, 
tapping a link in a webView, 
cell reordering in a tableView 
and refreshControl.

It seems UI tests are finicky.

Most of this wonderful project is from here:
